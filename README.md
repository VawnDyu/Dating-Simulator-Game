# üéÆ Visual Novel Game (Unfinished)

A personal project made with Python and the Tkinter GUI toolkit, this Visual Novel Game is a work-in-progress that blends storytelling, character interaction, and a passion for game development.
It's currently in development as I continue to work on storylines, character sprites, and background art.
